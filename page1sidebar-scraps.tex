\cvsection{Achievements}

\cvachievement{\faCode}{Self-taught Web Development}{More than 7 years of weekends, nights, mornings before even getting out of bed to meticulously complete tutorials and workshops, matching work hours with my partner in medical residency, I'm perpetually honing the ability to create and deploy my own full-stack web applications in javascript on bare-metal and cloud. Ask me about my side-projects.}

\cvachievement{\faCodeFork}{Catalyzed the creation of new branch within Columbia Dept. of Psychiatry}{I saw a need, wrote a proposal to the institute directors, and subsequently, the MRI Compute team was born, and I filled a new role which I defined.}

\cvachievement{\faFlask}{Learning Photochemistry}{Learned to design my own eco-friendly alternatives to my favorite developing agents for fractions of the cost. Gained free access to local darkroom by providing this skill as a service and cutting their operating costs.}
